<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Malina-Mihaela Cabel and I recently graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, specializing in Technologies and Telecommunications Systems.
</p>
<p>I can say that I am a very friendly, loyal, empathetic and quite ambitious person.</p>
<p> 
  In the future, I want to find a job that represents me and satisfies me from several points of view, but also to found a family where I can grow old gracefully.
